You can just download this client and do this command:

make sure you use node v16 >

# How it works?

### 1. You have to download metamask ext in your browser

### 2. After that connect your wallet to goerli net

### 3. After connected, you must have goerli eth amounts, if you are not having that, you can use goerli faucet

### 4. Try to write and fill the form, and you are already storing the data to block chain!!

this client already deployed in this url: 


# In contract branch there is a smart contract that has been deployed to goerli eth

## For local purposes you can download ganache

## For test net, this contract is already deployed to goerli testnet.
